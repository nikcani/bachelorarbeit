- I have worked with both and found Filament much easier to work with.
- Another problem I encountered with Nova is that customers without a technical background have a difficult time to work
with Nova.
- Customising nova is really difficult.
- I've used both, and i still use both , but i prefer filament for it's community and easy customization, but i still
use nova for vue projects.
- Nova is perfect if you don't need customization
- In my experience if you don’t need alot of custom work use Nova cause it’s easier and way faster to develop with.
- If you need something custom use filament.
- Filament is a lot easier to customize and extend. Mainly because you don’t have the compile Vue, etc.
